# we will practice user inputs using a math lib game
# this game collects information from the user and prints it inside a funny story and displays it back to them

# lets create some variables
noun1 = input("enter your first noun, a known person:")
noun2 = input("enter your second noun, a known place:")
noun3 = input("enter your third noun, an animal pet:")
adj = input("enter an adjective:")
verb = input("enter a verb:")

print(f"I was walking my {noun3} down the busy {noun2} street and i saw {noun1}, {noun1} was{verb}ing {adj}")
