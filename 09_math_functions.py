# Lets look at some basic arithmetic operators

# addition (+)
count = 0           # value of 0 assigned to count variable
count = count + 1   # increment count by adding 1 (gives 1)
count += 1          # augmented assignment operator; same result (gives 2)
print(count)

# subtraction (-)
count = 0           # reset the calue of count to 0
count -= 1          # subtract 1 from value of count (gives -1)
print(count)

# multiplication (*)
count = 2
count *= 2          # multiplies 2 by the value of count (gives 4)
print(count)

# division (/)
count = 5
count /= 2          # divides the value of count by 2 (gives 2.5)
print(count)

# exponentiation (**)
count = 5
count **= 2         # raises the value of count to the power of 2 (gives 25)
print(count)

# remainder (%)
count = 10
count %= 7          # remainder (called modulus) of the division of the value of count by 7 (gives 3)
print(count)
